# Numbers

- From Lua 5.3, it uses two representations for numbers:
    - 64-bit integer numbers, called *integers*.
    - double-precision floating-points numbers, called *floats*. 
- Lua supports hexadecimal constants, by prefixing them with 0x.

## Arithmetic operators
- +, -, *, /, //, %, ^

## Relational operators
- <, >, <=, >=, ==, ~=

## The Mathematical Library
- Lua has a standard math library:
    - trigonometric functions
    - logarithms
    - rounding functions
    - max and min
    - random number generation
    - pi constant and huge (the largest representable number, *inf*)
